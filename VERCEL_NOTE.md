# Why HotSeat Can't Run on Vercel

## The Problem

HotSeat uses **Socket.IO with a custom Node.js server** (`server.js`). This requires:
- Persistent server process
- Long-lived WebSocket connections
- Stateful connections

Vercel's serverless architecture:
- Stateless functions
- No persistent processes
- Limited connection duration (10 seconds)
- **Cannot maintain WebSocket connections**

## Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy to Railway or Render ✅ (Recommended)
See `DEPLOY.md` for complete instructions.

### Option 2: Refactor for Vercel (Complex)
Would require:
1. Moving Socket.IO server to separate service (Railway/Render)
2. Splitting frontend/backend into separate repos
3. Updating client code to connect to external Socket.IO server
4. Managing CORS and authentication

**Time estimate:** 4-8 hours of refactoring

### Option 3: Use Serverless Alternatives
Replace Socket.IO with:
- Pusher (paid after trial)
- Ably (paid after generous free tier)
- Supabase Realtime (free tier available)
- Vercel's own Realtime (beta)

**Time estimate:** 6-12 hours to rewrite real-time logic

## Recommendation

**Deploy to Railway or Render** (see `DEPLOY.md`).

Benefits:
- ✅ Works with current code
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Easy deployment
- ✅ PostgreSQL database included
- ✅ WebSocket support out of the box

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Vercel | Railway | Render |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| Socket.IO Support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Free Tier | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| PostgreSQL | ❌ No* | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Ease of Deploy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Custom Server | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

*Vercel requires external database

**Bottom line:** Use Railway or Render for HotSeat. It works immediately without code changes.
